  Long-term (trend) forecasts are much more effective than short-term forecasts. For predictions that contain opening price information, the information ratio is very low, so the validity and accuracy are low relative to closing price information

  长线（趋势）预测的准确率和有效性相对短线来说要更高些。对于包含开盘价信息的预测，IC值相对收盘预测是要低的，所以参考价值也有限。
